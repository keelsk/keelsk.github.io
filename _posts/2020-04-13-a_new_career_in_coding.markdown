I decided to pursue a career in software engineering, because I want to design digital resources for teachers and students. Overall, I thought this career choice would be the perfect opportunity to combine my three passions: teaching, mathematics, and technology! 

I taught at a technology magnet school for 6 years and it was my job to integrate technology into instruction in innovative ways. I enjoyed this challenge, but I still wanted to dig deeper and learn to design research-based math instruction! 

So, I went to graduate school to pursue my doctorate in mathematics education. I spent five years in the program and my graduate assistantship also focused on teaching. In fact, I taught college students to design tasks that encourage elementary students to make sense of mathematics—not just memorize rules. 

After spending 5 years pouring over journal articles and whatnot, I want a career that allows me make good use of this knowledge. My research focuses on reaching students who struggle with mathematics, and until a few months ago, I always thought that I would become a professor after graduating. However, I found my way back into coding last year, and I have a new vision for my future. 

I say back into coding, because I was always interested in it ever since I got a Vtech computer for my 10th birthday. I came across programming lessons that taught BASIC programming language on this “toy,” and I was glued to the screen for hours every day. I thought it was so cool that I could make a computer say things and do mathematics, which was and still is my favorite subject. 

When I went to college, I thought I would focus on programming as an undergraduate, but double majoring in computer science and elementary education didn't mix. My advisor told me that a minor wasn’t allowed if I pursued elementary education, and according to him, double majoring was definitely out of the question! Computer programming courses were held during the day and I had internships at elementary schools from 7am to 3pm most days. So, I chose education and somehow made my way back to computer programming years later. 

Last December, I decided to do this free bootcamp I found online for Flatiron School. The rest is history! I’ve decided that I would enjoy using my research to create eLearning materials and online interventions for students and teachers to use. I've always been fairly creative, and I think it would be neat to design a portfolio showcasing the work I complete while tailoring it to mathematics education. This would challenge me to think outside of the box and apply what I’m learning to a field that I love!

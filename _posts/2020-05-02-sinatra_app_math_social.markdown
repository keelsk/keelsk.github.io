I created a social networking app for elementary students where they can help each other solve story problems. The app allows a user to: 

* Set up and account
* Follow and unfollow math buddies in their class
* View a minifeed of all their math buddies' solution
* Solve problems and add them to their math portfolio
* Comment on math solutions posted on the website

The user can create, read, update, and delete their solutions, comments, and friends. 

For me, the most challenging part of the process was figuring out how to generate the math problems and fixing layout issues with CSS. For the problem generator, I used a lot of helper methods, but I put them in the app controller. I'm still not sure if this was the best way to do it. However, I can always refactor later. I was also thinking if I should even have a problem model at all. Perhaps, it would have been best to place the problem and answer in the Solution model. 

I used Bootstrap 4 for my layout, and I have NEVER used it before. I knew it wasn't the focus of this project, but since there were a few lessons on CSS in Module 11 leading up to this project, I wanted to challenge myself to try it. There are still a few layout issues that I'm not happy about, but I think it was great practice for the future. 

I'm very proud of how [Math Social](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPiRGyjSugc&feature=youtu.be) turned out!
